                                Each 3-wheeler is split into 50 fractions at $50 each. Once assigned to a rider, it begins a 60-week lease-to-own plan. Investors earn up to a target of 45% ROI over the 60-week period, distributed proportionally to their share.

                                If a driver misses or delays payments, the vehicle is repossessed and reassigned. We partner with a bank that covers both missed and late payments during this period, ensuring payout consistency for investors.

                                We partner with local driver unions who already assign vehicles and receive new driver applications daily. These unions help us vet drivers through ID checks, background screening, and in-person interviews. Our team then works with them to offer competitive lease-to-own options to qualified drivers within their network.
